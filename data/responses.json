A lot of people have theories on what they do but I wanted to personalize it. A major part of this application allows you log the previous 4 days of weather leading up to the day that you went fishing and the day of that trip. The application then allows you to filter your trips based on the same information for an upcoming trip. This allows you to see how, individually, you fish best in those conditions. You can also record the water conditions and add your own notes to the trips so that you can easily reference these items.",

These spaces are hubs for full-time artists, part-time hobbyists, and general enthusiasts that like to buy local, handmade stuff. Makerspaces can enable makers to actually make money off their craft, but it's often hard for a consumer, who wants to hire or buy from a local maker, to figure out who the Makerspace members are and what they are capable of creating. The current system is a hodgepodge of member databases, spreadsheets, and business cards on a table. It's hard to point an interested client in the direction of the right maker. In comes MakerBoard. It's an online board for Makerspaces where members can post their profile and customers can get in contact with the right person for their job. It takes all of the guess work out of finding capable makers for jobs.",

It was painful helping meet organizers enter results which were hand written on an index card into a spreadsheet. Results were slow to be publish, because of faxes, snail mailing and emails.
