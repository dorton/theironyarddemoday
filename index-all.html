            <h4>About The Iron Yard</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard Academy teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer. Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying either Ruby on Rails Engineering or Front End Engineering and today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

A search on Dishes in Montrose will return dishes on flippable cards that include photos, a map of the restaurant location, ingredients included and the ability to upvote tasty dishes.</p>

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) produced by Wizards of the Coast. Despite its complex ruleset, D&D remains largely a pencil-and-paper-and-rulebook game with few, if any, digital tools existing to create and track characters over multiple games. As gamers, we made a product that we ourselves would use for this purpose.</p>

As I have grown older that fascination has become an obsession. I received my degree in accounting from Texas A&M Univ. Whooooop but I came to realize after a year of non profit accounting that it was not the career for me. Solving problems and building things that make people's life just a bit easier or simpler  is what drove me to development.  The joy that I get from programming  along with the ability to contribute meaningful work is what keeps me coming back up. </p>

There were a few reasons behind the creation of the app. First, I really wanted a way to track my workouts and I didn't want to carry a notebook around at the gym. Secondly, I thought back to when I was a teen and I Idolized great athletes and wondered what type of workouts they did. Lastly to solve a problem for those who want to workout but just don't know what to do.</p>

    <p class="hideable">Houston is a great city to experience live theatre. The Alley and Hobby Center are wonderful, large playhouses downtown. But what if downtown Houston is a far commute or tickets to one of the larger venues are not in the budget? There is more than likely a community theatre close to you which you don't even know about. Curtain Up Houston aims to change that. Houston has a thriving community theatre scene that everyone should know about and be a part of. Simply enter your location and get connected with theatre in your area! If you are a venue or theatre company and want to be more exposed to the public you can sign up and make a profile that everyone can see!</p>

As gamers, we made a product that we ourselves would use for this purpose.</p>

            <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan _ all before he was 6 _ and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS & Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

            <p>Lindsay lived in four different locations before high school, and after graduating from Bryan College in Dayton, TN, she taught English as a second language in Seoul, Korea for 16 months. Lindsay keeps the travel bug at bay by spending time with her husband and puppy and exploring the ethnic restaurants in Atlanta. Since laying down roots through community involvement and different dance classes, the city has become home. Discovering The Iron Yard's Atlanta campus and becoming a part of the team in 2015 was a catalyst for Lindsay to invest even more in the community while capitalizing on her penchants for organization and efficiency as the Campus Operations Manager. The excellent Vietnamese restaurant down the street just sweetened the deal.

Originally from Charleston, SC, he attended Clemson University and spent several years in Greenville, although long before the Iron Yard emerged. He may be an Orlando transplant, but -- like many other invasive species -- has become deeply rooted since being introduced. He leads monthly user groups, speaks at local tech conferences, and mentors others in his spare time. You can find him online by his unique pseudonym 'AL the X' and IRL by his penchant for haberdashery.

            <p>Justin spent the first 29 years of his life living in Massachusetts, Florida and New York. His move to Texas to teach for The Iron Yard was like a journey into the past. Exactly one hour into the past. Things just move a little more slowly here in the Central Time Zone, and we like it that way. Back in the future, Justin started out as a journalist. After spending a few years indulging his muse as a writer he moved on to study Natural Language Processing, the branch of computer science that deals with understanding and using human language. Essentially he's Joaquim Phoenix from the movie Her. He brings his love for language and his curiosity about AI (or the semblance thereof) to his Iron Yard curriculum on Front End Engineering and Python/Data Science.</p>

            <p>Sally grew up in Davidson, NC, but fled the south as soon as she could. She studied Math at Swarthmore College in not-so-sunny Pennsylvania, then fled the snow back to the south as soon as she could return, spending a few years in Chapel Hill studying Information Science at UNC and finally landing in Charleston, SC. She has spent most of the past seven years hanging out with developers in various capacities and has even picked up a little code herself. She spends her free time chasing her twin boys, pursuing the perfect gluten free cookie, and playing roller derby as her alter ego, Whippopotamus.

            </p>

            <p>Ben grew up in Orlando, Florida and has been a tech nerd of one type or another his whole life. After teaching himself Linux administration and shell scripting, he tackled desktop Java development on several different projects, including one for the Department of Defense. Following some more Java development in the private sector and a dabble in Windows .NET programming for the now defunct Windows Mobile platform, he got hooked on the unique challenge presented by the limiting constraints of mobile programming. Upon the iPhone release, Ben began a 5 year exploration of Cocoa and Objective-C. Recently discovering the Iron Yard, he changed course once again to become the iOS instructor for TIY's Orlando campus. Ben is ready to dive in head first and do his best to serve the Iron Yard and its students well. Oh, and occasionally he likes to actually dive for real, mostly in the spectacular reefs and shipwrecks off the coast of Florida.

            <p>Brian is a proud product of Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania (midway between the state capitol and the Little League Hall of Fame; home of the World's Longest Banana Split). He has spent most of his life either teaching and tutoring - including math from long division to calculus, physics, beer brewing, chemical engineering, and kung fu, plus web development - or computering, playing with Fortran, Perl, PHP, Javascript, and Ruby. Ruby is the one that makes him smile, and it'll do the same for you. (Just say it out loud. 'Ruby. Rooobeeee.' See?)

            <p>Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

            <p>Brit taught himself programming in 2008 and never looked back. Though his professional background is web development with Ruby and Python, Brit's favorite hobby project is a Nintendo emulator written in Lisp. Brit is fascinated by the history of software, the interplay between academia and industry, and the unique challenges of legacy code. If he's not mumbling about macros or working on his open source projects, you can probably find him playing with his dogs, making cocktails, and trying to learn more about fighting games and sound synthesis.

            </p>

            <p>Jo started as a designer while studying at the Creative Circus, which has cursed him with the need to critique any and all bad design implementation. After getting a taste of code as a web developer, he found his passion and constantly pushed himself to learn more. That journey led him his true love: building apps for mobile devices. After launching several top-notch iOS apps, he landed at startup HighFive, a mobile rewards platform that tracks user activities and chooses when to offer rewards. His passion for education has never left, though, so he joined our team as an iOS instructor to help others discover the beauty of Objective-C.
