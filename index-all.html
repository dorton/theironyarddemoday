            <h4>About The Iron Yard</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard Academy teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer. Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying either Ruby on Rails Engineering or Front End Engineering and today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

    <p class="hideable">People love 2 things in the world, food and impulse shopping. Combining that with a social media aspect and you have SavorIt. Savorit is a social media app with the basic idea of your friends posting food that they have eaten at certain restaurants in your local area. The main distinction between this and instagram is that all of these food products in your local area can be bought and delivered straight from the SavorIt application. Thus feeding all of your food cravings and also giving you ideas of what you want to eat instead of going to Yelp, searching through a ton of random restaurants and deciding what you want after looking at their menu. The pictures give users a mental stimulation of what you actually want to eat and the capability to buy whatever food you want that your friends are showing you. </p>

    <p class="hideable">Alpine takes its inspiration from the building murals that are found in Alpine, Texas.  This application provides an approach to  “shoeboxing” an image for safe keeping.   Alpine provides a method to catalog, reference and display building art I find and keep the images and locations documented for later reference.  An image can be captured and transferred to the application with the time and location data extracted from the image data. Users can vote on their favorite murals and view them on a map, helping the daily commuter experience a hidden world that would perhaps otherwise not be seen.</p>

    <p class="hideable">History is a subject important to fully understanding society and the world around us. Unfortuantely, any kids don't get in to history...in fact, they find it boring. Learning History Early is an app presented as an interactive timeline that kids can scroll through. The timeline lists several interesting figures from history: some that kids may know and others they may not have heard of before. The experience of this app allows kids early access to history in a way that is accessible and fun to them.

    <p class="hideable">Having been raised in Kansas, then moving around the East Coast and abroad, I always found an interest in seeing what large city I might venture to next. However, there are certain factors (in my case, housing prices and diversity) that influence  the next place I could call “home.” Often times just reading numbers and statistics about the demographic make-up of a city can be quite hard to immediately grasp. Carto-graphic allows users to see maps of housing prices and racial diversity by zip code in several of the US’s largest cities. When presented with these visual representations, data is much easier to make sense of and understand. This website is ideal for those who want to find a neighborhood that is within their price range and fits their diversity preferences. It is also a great learning tool for those who are interested in seeing how different cities are composed.</p>

    <p class="hideable">Born and raised in Houston, TX, I have always had a fascination technology.  From playing Super Mario Bro's on the nintendo to building apps and websites in javascript, I always wanted one thing, to learn more. I am a  passionate musician playing guitar for a band with my brother, and an amateur boxer competing the Houston Golden Gloves.  I knew I had knack for technology and had a bit of experience doing it in highschool.  It felt like a no brainer to finally pursue a career in something I loved since I was a kid.  I dream of building apps with the likes of Pandora,  Spotify, and ReverbNation to bring my loves of music and technology together.  </p>
    <p class="hideable">
Music was my first love before I thought to code.   I played in a metal band with my brother since highschool  and lots of practice went into making sure our songs were tight and show performance was on point.  One of the biggest problems however was just getting 5 guys in a room at the same time and place.  Jam Sesh is a tool to help bands organize and set practice dates and shows.  As a leader,  you can set practice dates and times while gaining the notification when your band mates see and approve it.  As a member, you can quickly see when the next practice or show is and send your leader confirmation that you'll be there.  Built for mobile devices and desktop view,  its quick, responsive, and intuitive design will let band mates know who will make it, and who's down for a Jam Sesh.</p>

The gift-giver includes a URL that can securely link to an Amazon gift card, Steam key, or other digital reward, then the gift's recipient is notified that *a surprise* is coming, and they can watch as an animated gift horse gallops ever closer along an incremental progress bar. Patience may be its own reward, but it doesn't hurt when it comes with a GiftHorse bearing gifts!</p>

                <i>Front End Instructor</i>
            </p>

            <p>While also a long-time freelancer and full-stack developer, David really loves teaching. He helped design and teach the Web Development AS program for Valencia College, authored the 'Shaping Up with Angular JS' course for Code School, and is writing additional curriculum for more advanced students. Originally from Charleston, SC, he attended Clemson University and spent several years in Greenville, although long before the Iron Yard emerged. He may be an Orlando transplant, but -- like many other invasive species -- has become deeply rooted since being introduced. He leads monthly user groups, speaks at local tech conferences, and mentors others in his spare time. You can find him online by his unique pseudonym 'AL the X' and IRL by his penchant for haberdashery.

            </p>

            <p>Justin spent the first 29 years of his life living in Massachusetts, Florida and New York. His move to Texas to teach for The Iron Yard was like a journey into the past. Exactly one hour into the past. Things just move a little more slowly here in the Central Time Zone, and we like it that way. Back in the future, Justin started out as a journalist. After spending a few years indulging his muse as a writer he moved on to study Natural Language Processing, the branch of computer science that deals with understanding and using human language. Essentially he's Joaquim Phoenix from the movie Her. He brings his love for language and his curiosity about AI (or the semblance thereof) to his Iron Yard curriculum on Front End Engineering and Python/Data Science.</p>

She loves new stories and old books, and when she has free time, likes to experiment with crafting and sewing, as well as baking French pastries.

            <p>Sally grew up in Davidson, NC, but fled the south as soon as she could. She studied Math at Swarthmore College in not-so-sunny Pennsylvania, then fled the snow back to the south as soon as she could return, spending a few years in Chapel Hill studying Information Science at UNC and finally landing in Charleston, SC. She has spent most of the past seven years hanging out with developers in various capacities and has even picked up a little code herself. She spends her free time chasing her twin boys, pursuing the perfect gluten free cookie, and playing roller derby as her alter ego, Whippopotamus.

He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from the man. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably Future of Web Apps Boston, JSFest, and JS.Everywhere(2013).

            </p>

            <p>Ben grew up in Orlando, Florida and has been a tech nerd of one type or another his whole life. After teaching himself Linux administration and shell scripting, he tackled desktop Java development on several different projects, including one for the Department of Defense. Following some more Java development in the private sector and a dabble in Windows .NET programming for the now defunct Windows Mobile platform, he got hooked on the unique challenge presented by the limiting constraints of mobile programming. Upon the iPhone release, Ben began a 5 year exploration of Cocoa and Objective-C. Recently discovering the Iron Yard, he changed course once again to become the iOS instructor for TIY's Orlando campus. Ben is ready to dive in head first and do his best to serve the Iron Yard and its students well. Oh, and occasionally he likes to actually dive for real, mostly in the spectacular reefs and shipwrecks off the coast of Florida.

He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

            <p>Brit taught himself programming in 2008 and never looked back. Though his professional background is web development with Ruby and Python, Brit's favorite hobby project is a Nintendo emulator written in Lisp. Brit is fascinated by the history of software, the interplay between academia and industry, and the unique challenges of legacy code. If he's not mumbling about macros or working on his open source projects, you can probably find him playing with his dogs, making cocktails, and trying to learn more about fighting games and sound synthesis.

After getting a taste of code as a web developer, he found his passion and constantly pushed himself to learn more. That journey led him his true love: building apps for mobile devices. After launching several top-notch iOS apps, he landed at startup HighFive, a mobile rewards platform that tracks user activities and chooses when to offer rewards. His passion for education has never left, though, so he joined our team as an iOS instructor to help others discover the beauty of Objective-C.
