            <h4>About The Iron Yard Academy</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard Academy teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer. Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying either Ruby on Rails Engineering or Front End Engineering and today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

                <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from "the man". The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably <a href="https://futureofwebapps.com/" target="_Blank">Future of Web Apps Boston</a>, <a href="http://jsfest.com/" target="_Blank">JSFest</a>, and <a href="http://www.jseverywhere.org/" target="_Blank">JS.Everywhere(2013)</a>. He also is organizing a JavaScript conference right here in Houston: <a href="http://spacecityjs.com/" target="_Blank">Space City JS</a>.</p>

                <p class="hideable">JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan &dash; all before he was 6 &dash; and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS &amp; Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

                <p class="hideable">Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&mp;M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same “ah ha” moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

It displays all this information on a Map powered by Leaflet.js, and while your deciding about where you want to go for your next concert, you can listen to a music selection provided the Spotify Play-Button. It is an open source Ruby-on-Rails project at https://github.com/scarecrow182000/Chartography and coming soon as a live site at http://chartography.herokuapp.com/.</p>

I attended 3-Day Startup event at the University of Houston and realized that I could use my development skills to build an app that connects local food growers with restaurants that want to purchase produce. I haven't finished the app, but my vision is that farmers and restaurants will be able to use it to facilitate the process of selling and purchasing local produce. Farmers will be able to utilize it to list their product, view their billing/delivery info, and organize their sales. Restaurants will be able to use it to see what produce is available locally, place orders, and view their account status with each farmer.</p>
