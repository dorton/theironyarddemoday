            <h4>About The Iron Yard Academy</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard Academy teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer. Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying either Ruby on Rails Engineering or Front End Engineering and today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

    <p class="hideable">LiftWhen - A Focus On The Platform: State of the industry in the administration and running of an Olympic Weightlifting competition involves index cards and Microsoft Excel. Broken.

My application moves this administration, record keeping and information display from the table top with index cards to modernity. We allow the admin to focus on saving time, data integrity and communication. We allow coaches to focus on coaching not counting. We help fans cheer by enabling ease of information reporting. Finally we help athletes focus on lifting. We bring the sport back to a focus on the performance on the platform. 

I developed this application using my experience as a certified USA Weightlifting coach and competitor. It was painful as coach counting reps, competitors and estimating timelines for my athletes performance. Information was hard to come by. It was painful helping meet organizers enter results which were hand written on an index card into a spreadsheet. Results were slow to be publish, because of faxes, snail mailing and emails. Payment was painful because checks. 

In short we make it easier for meet organizers to run a successful meet, and report results. </p>

    <p class="hideable">A lot of anglers like to keep a log of their fishing trips for reference. I couldn’t find a decent application that made this experience very helpful or easy. So, I decided to make this a digital process and one that would help me on my future fishing trips. Fish respond to weather conditions in different ways. A lot of people have theories on what they do but I wanted to personalize it. A major part of this application allows you log the previous 4 days of weather leading up to the day that you went fishing and the day of that trip. The application then allows you to filter your trips based on the same information for an upcoming trip. This allows you to see how, individually, you fish best in those conditions. You can also record the water conditions and add your own notes to the trips so that you can easily reference these items.</p>

    <p class="hideable">As a developer, I'm passionate about helping small businesses and brands transform their realities. This means leading stakeholders through the process of incorporating new and innovative technologies into their operations. Metro Retro is perhaps the largest dealer of vintage Mid Century furniture in the United States. They needed a sharp looking and nimble website, with specific administrative capabilities, in order to better serve the global high end marketplace. </p>

    <p class="hideable">The Maker movement is empowering people worldwide to go out and make things, from websites to tables to jewelry. It's awesome, but these makers sometimes lack the equipment required to make the cool things they want to make. Enter the Makerspace: a warehouse of equipment that members pay a monthly fee to use. These spaces are hubs for full-time artists, part-time hobbyists, and general enthusiasts that like to buy local, handmade stuff. Makerspaces can enable makers to actually make money off their craft, but it's often hard for a consumer, who wants to hire or buy from a local maker, to figure out who the Makerspace members are and what they are capable of creating. The current system is a hodgepodge of member databases, spreadsheets, and business cards on a table. It's hard to point an interested client in the direction of the right maker. In comes MakerBoard. It's an online board for Makerspaces where members can post their profile and customers can get in contact with the right person for their job. It takes all of the guess work out of finding capable makers for jobs.</p>

    <p class="hideable">I wanted to create an app that would allow users to discover the different breweries out there as well as facilitate the planning process to visit them. So Beercast appeared, a webApp that allows you to search for breweries by location and get the details for that brewery alongside the weather for that area. This way you can plan the day around the brewery of your choice. Happy drinking!</p>

            </p>

            <p>Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from "the man". The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably Future of Web Apps Boston, JSFest, and JS.Everywhere(2013). He also is organizing a JavaScript conference right here in Houston: Space City JS.</p>

            </p>

            <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan _ all before he was 6 _ and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS & Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>
