            <p>The Iron Yard teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level
              programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer.
              Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying Front End Engineering and Rails Engineering and
              today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

A search on Dishes in Montrose will return dishes on flippable cards that include photos, a map of the restaurant location, ingredients included and the ability to upvote tasty dishes.</p>

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) produced by Wizards of the Coast. Despite its complex ruleset, D&D remains largely a pencil-and-paper-and-rulebook game with few, if any, digital tools existing to create and track characters over multiple games. As gamers, we made a product that we ourselves would use for this purpose.</p>

As I have grown older that fascination has become an obsession. I received my degree in accounting from Texas A&M Univ. Whooooop but I came to realize after a year of non profit accounting that it was not the career for me. Solving problems and building things that make people's life just a bit easier or simpler  is what drove me to development.  The joy that I get from programming  along with the ability to contribute meaningful work is what keeps me coming back up. </p>

There were a few reasons behind the creation of the app. First, I really wanted a way to track my workouts and I didn't want to carry a notebook around at the gym. Secondly, I thought back to when I was a teen and I Idolized great athletes and wondered what type of workouts they did. Lastly to solve a problem for those who want to workout but just don't know what to do.</p>

Houston is a fantastic city and I believe the best way to keep it that way is for its communities to be actively involved with it's growth.

    <p class="hideable">Houston is a great city to experience live theatre. The Alley and Hobby Center are wonderful, large playhouses downtown. But what if downtown Houston is a far commute or tickets to one of the larger venues are not in the budget? There is more than likely a community theatre close to you which you don''t even know about. Curtain Up Houston aims to change that. Houston has a thriving community theatre scene that everyone should know about and be a part of. Simply enter your location and get connected with theatre in your area! If you are a venue or theatre company and want to be more exposed to the public you can sign up and make a profile that everyone can see!</p>

Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game (RPG) produced by Wizards of the Coast.

As gamers, we made a product that we ourselves would use for this purpose.</p>

            <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan _ all before he was 6 _ and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS & Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

            <p>Justin spent the first 29 years of his life living in Massachusetts, Florida and New York. His move to Texas to teach for The Iron Yard was like a journey into the past. Exactly one hour into the past. Things just move a little more slowly here in the Central Time Zone, and we like it that way. Back in the future, Justin started out as a journalist. After spending a few years indulging his muse as a writer he moved on to study Natural Language Processing, the branch of computer science that deals with understanding and using human language. Essentially he's Joaquim Phoenix from the movie Her. He brings his love for language and his curiosity about AI (or the semblance thereof) to his Iron Yard curriculum on Front End Engineering and Python/Data Science.</p>

            <p>Christie was born in Houston, TX and was lucky enough to move to Nigeria when she was two weeks old.  She spent the first few years of her life in Nigeria and Angola before moving to Boston, Tulsa and then back to Houston.  Those early adventures sparked a lifelong love of travel and she has been all over the world and still has many places on her “list” to see one day.  She graduated from The Art Institute of Houston with an AAS degree in Film Production and earned her BA in Communications/PR/Advertising with a minor in English from The University of Houston. Christie spent many years in sales before becoming an Assistant Director of Admissions at her alma matter, The Art Institute of Houston. This was where she discovered her passion for helping others achieve their dreams through education. She is involved with a number of charities that help children, animals, veterans and others.  In her spare time, she loves to travel the world, write films, spend time with friends and family and hanging out with her two dachshunds Ben and Betty Lou.</p>

He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

                <strong>TRAVIS HUBBARD</strong>
                <br>
                <i>Teacher Assistant</i>
            </p>

            <p>Travis wrote his first line of Javascript on his birthday in 2014 and has been obsessed with coding ever since. He went through the Iron Yard program in the winter of 2014 and has worked as a teacher assistant during the last two cohorts helping students with everything from page layouts, Javascript syntax basics, advanced frameworks, user interface development, and programmatic problem solving. Recently, he has fallen in love with React.js and will talk to all interested and uninterested parties about the merits of the framework. When not in front of a computer, Travis enjoys miscellaneous events around the city, salsa dancing, two steppin, cooking, reading, and spending time with family.</p>
