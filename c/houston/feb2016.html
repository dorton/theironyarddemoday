            <p>The Iron Yard teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level
              programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer.
              Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying Front End Engineering and Rails Engineering and
              today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

    <p class="hideable">People love 2 things in the world, food and impulse shopping. Combining that with a social media aspect and you have SavorIt. Savorit is a social media app with the basic idea of your friends posting food that they have eaten at certain restaurants in your local area. The main distinction between this and instagram is that all of these food products in your local area can be bought and delivered straight from the SavorIt application. Thus feeding all of your food cravings and also giving you ideas of what you want to eat instead of going to Yelp, searching through a ton of random restaurants and deciding what you want after looking at their menu. The pictures give users a mental stimulation of what you actually want to eat and the capability to buy whatever food you want that your friends are showing you. </p>

    <p class="hideable">Alpine takes its inspiration from the building murals that are found in Alpine, Texas.  This application provides an approach to  “shoeboxing” an image for safe keeping.   Alpine provides a method to catalog, reference and display building art I find and keep the images and locations documented for later reference.  An image can be captured and transferred to the application with the time and location data extracted from the image data. Users can vote on their favorite murals and view them on a map, helping the daily commuter experience a hidden world that would perhaps otherwise not be seen.</p>

    <p class="hideable">History is a subject important to fully understanding society and the world around us. Unfortuantely, any kids don't get in to history...in fact, they find it boring. Learning History Early is an app presented as an interactive timeline that kids can scroll through. The timeline lists several interesting figures from history: some that kids may know and others they may not have heard of before. The experience of this app allows kids early access to history in a way that is accessible and fun to them.

    <p class="hideable">Having been raised in Kansas, then moving around the East Coast and abroad, I always found an interest in seeing what large city I might venture to next. However, there are certain factors (in my case, housing prices and diversity) that influence  the next place I could call “home.” Often times just reading numbers and statistics about the demographic make-up of a city can be quite hard to immediately grasp. Carto-graphic allows users to see maps of housing prices and racial diversity by zip code in several of the US’s largest cities. When presented with these visual representations, data is much easier to make sense of and understand. This website is ideal for those who want to find a neighborhood that is within their price range and fits their diversity preferences. It is also a great learning tool for those who are interested in seeing how different cities are composed.</p>

    <p class="hideable">Born and raised in Houston, TX, I have always had a fascination technology.  From playing Super Mario Bro's on the nintendo to building apps and websites in javascript, I always wanted one thing, to learn more. I am a  passionate musician playing guitar for a band with my brother, and an amateur boxer competing the Houston Golden Gloves.  I knew I had knack for technology and had a bit of experience doing it in highschool.  It felt like a no brainer to finally pursue a career in something I loved since I was a kid.  I dream of building apps with the likes of Pandora,  Spotify, and ReverbNation to bring my loves of music and technology together.  </p>
    <p class="hideable">
Music was my first love before I thought to code.   I played in a metal band with my brother since highschool  and lots of practice went into making sure our songs were tight and show performance was on point.  One of the biggest problems however was just getting 5 guys in a room at the same time and place.  Jam Sesh is a tool to help bands organize and set practice dates and shows.  As a leader,  you can set practice dates and times while gaining the notification when your band mates see and approve it.  As a member, you can quickly see when the next practice or show is and send your leader confirmation that you'll be there.  Built for mobile devices and desktop view,  its quick, responsive, and intuitive design will let band mates know who will make it, and who's down for a Jam Sesh.</p>

The gift-giver includes a URL that can securely link to an Amazon gift card, Steam key, or other digital reward, then the gift's recipient is notified that *a surprise* is coming, and they can watch as an animated gift horse gallops ever closer along an incremental progress bar. Patience may be its own reward, but it doesn't hurt when it comes with a GiftHorse bearing gifts!</p>

He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from the man. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably Future of Web Apps Boston, JSFest, and JS.Everywhere(2013). He also is organizing a JavaScript conference right here in Houston: Space City JS.</p>

                <br>
                <i>Campus Director</i>
            </p>

            <p>Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>
