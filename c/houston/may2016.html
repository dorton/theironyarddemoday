            <h4>About The Iron Yard</h4>

            <p>The Iron Yard teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level
              programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer.
              Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying Mobile Engineering, Front End Engineering, and Rails Engineering and
              today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

    <p class="hideable">Steven Greenup has a B.S. in Civil Engineering, and worked as a Civil/Structural E.I.T. for three years. Working as an engineer, he realized many of his daily tasks could be automated. He found himself learning to write macros in Visual Basic to analyze large amounts of Excel data.  He became an Engineer to create things he could be proud of, but found himself creating standard versions of simple structures in order to make the company he was working for the most money. Working tirelessly to create someone else’s dream, he realized that writing code could provide a way to build a fulfilling career.  Steven identified the Iron Yard Rails Development Program as a way to alter his career trajectory. Joining The Iron Yard was one of the best decisions he could have ever make, because he is finally doing something that makes him happy. Steven wants to build a lifelong career as a developer, no matter what it takes.</p>

    <p class="hideable">Originally from Venezuela, I grew up with a passion for technology and music; I moved to the US and went to Berklee College of Music, where I majored in Sound Design and Audio Engineering, focusing on Video Game Sound Design. I then started working for Sony PlayStation’s Sound Team and worked on a bunch of their games; In this and every other job I’ve ever had, there’s always been a huge programming component involved and I’ve always been intrigued by it.  The other side of me is very passionate about Strength Development and Nutrition, and I’ve always steered towards the science and numbers side of it; I’ve had all these ideas for health and workout systems that I’ve wanted to create but just didn’t have the skills to execute them.  That’s when I decided that it was finally the time to take the plunge and learn to code. It’s been awesome.</p>
    <p class="hideable">Meal Slice is the answer to "What do I eat if I want to lose (or gain) weight?".
Unless you're really into nutrition and fitness, you probably don't want to be bothered with tracking every bite of food you eat and weighing out every ingredient of every meal you cook, and the truth is you don't have to...
But then what do you do if you want to lose weight reliably and in a healthy manner? Meal Slice will calculate your nutritional needs using a unique algorithm using 7 different stats and create easy to follow meal plans that give you enough freedom to eat your favorite foods and still be able to meet your goals!</p>

    <p class="hideable">Sarah Swift: native Texan, licensed attorney, amateur chef, wanderlust writer who writes code. You might call her a flibbertigibbet or a dilettante. She calls herself curious. Though Swift lives in Houston, her heart is in Sewanee, Tennessee, on a mountain where she played lacrosse, studied religion, learned to love bourbon, and finally got Shakespeare. Her china cabinet is full of party hats which invariably come out when the punch bowl gets low. When she is sad, she reminds herself that she saved a drowning child's life; takes delight in the fact that her unassuming face compels strangers to tell her their secrets; and her internet research skills are peerless. Her itchy feet have taken her across northern Spain, up the Appalachian Trail, around the Annapurnas, and deep into the Grand Canyon. Swift now finds herself on the most exciting adventure: coding her future.</p>
    <p class="hideable">As a family law attorney, I spent a large portion of my practice dealing with client documents in various stages: exhibits for pleadings, discovery productions, settlement negotiations, and exhibits for trial. Swift Discovery is a client-driven, cloud-based e-discovery platform. SD provides clients with tools to share documents and privileged information with their attorneys, and with the ability to reduce document management costs. SD provides attorneys with a way to streamline the discovery process, capture, and visualize information. </p>

Although trained as a chemical engineer, Enrique has spent most of his professional career solving business problems for global corporations, most recently as a business developer at Samsung Electronics in Seoul, South Korea.  Ready to make an impact and take more risk starting his own company, Enrique will be going back to his home country after 14yrs with a plan to change people’s lives through education in technology.  Enrique’s favorite hobbies are classical singing and cycling and is extremely happy with his experience at The Iron Yard.</p>
    <p class="hideable">Catalyst simplifies life for students and teachers.

Knowledge transfer is cumbersome between teachers and students - particularly outside of class. Non-digital options require books, papers, reports, etc. that can be easily lost and are hard to carry around. Simple digital options such as email, solve some of the issues, but the material is still hard to deliver, organize, and track (by students and by teachers).

Catalyst facilitates digital content management for short-term courses such as coding bootcamps, languages, design, and others. It is simple and more user friendly than your typical Learning Management System. User experience was top-of-mind during the design process.

I plan to use this system as I embark on a new journey to change people’s lives in Mexico.</p>

Although the trend has been turning quite a bit, it has been true that positions in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) fields have been held by men. This leaves a dearth of experienced women for the up and coming lady STEM-ologists to speak and relate to. I have created a forum to encourage a meeting of the minds. Young women can post questions about any topic, ranging from handling personal situations to technical how-tos. Experienced women are able to show their knowledge in a much more personal and direct way. Just remember "I don't shine if you don't shine!"</p>

    <p class="hideable">I have a background in customer service and retail management and I have always thought that I would do well in a technical field. While doing research on the Information Technology career, I fell into a couple of coding tutorials and fell in love with the craft. This led to a decision to fully commit to making a 180 degree career change into programming. I joined the Iron Yard and the experience has been life changing  </p>
    <p class="hideable">I am huge fan of music and especially love exploring music through collecting records. Vinyl has a warmer sound and I love the physical aspects that come with listening to music on a record player. Along with my interest in the records, I am also fascinated by the stories of the collectors and how they got into the hobby. Vinyl Pi is mix of sharing your favorite records with other passionate collectors and share your story and hopefully inspire others to further explore other genres of music that they may not have given a chance to listen to. </p>

    <p class="hideable">Magic: The Gathering has a worldwide user base in the millions and has been around for 20 years. One of the primary points of popularity with the franchise is the perceived value of the cards themselves. This leads to trading and speculating, and as some of these cards are worth any where from a couple of bucks to hundreds and in some rare cases thousands of dollars. This leads to an element of trust between players looking for trades of their high end cards and this need is usually fulfilled by going to a local card shop that the traders trust. For the past five years, that place for many players in the North West Houston area was a small hole in the wall shop called Bad Wolf Trading. This past year has been rough on the little shop. Their location has become increasingly treacherous and management has been less than ideal. Long story short, they will be no more. This leaves a vacuum within the local community for a safe space for bringing and showing off trades. This is where Good Wolf Trading comes in, using a Magic API and backend database, GWT aims to provide users with a online trading experience that can be used to facilitate the trading of cards locally after trust has been established, and providing a view of the local trading pool prior to that. </p>

I have been asked several times in different conversations if prayer works. From my experience, one of the ways to know if something works is to track it. PrayrWorks is my attempt to answer that question. PrayrWorks is a simple way to organize, share and track your prayers. Bringing hope to people through prayer is something I'm most passionate about and PrayrWorks makes it easier for me.

I wanted something that would keep me challenged and motivated on a daily basis. I joined The Iron Yard to explore something that had always been an interest for me- programming. Since then, I have developed a serious passion for modern technology and have gained a desire to keep myself current in one of the most rapidly-changing industries out there.</p>
    <p class="hideable">
As I was sitting outside stargazing one evening, it dawned on me that the solar system is in constant motion. I became curious as to how quickly the planets were moving in relation to each another, so after a bit of research and thought, I began to create PlanetTrack as a means to always have an answer to this question. PlanetTrack uses actual data taken directly from NASA to display each planet's distance relative to every other one and also combines information about the solar system from many different sources into one simple iOS application that users can easily use to satisfy their curiosity about our place in the universe. </p>

    <p class="hideable">Although the recreational scuba industry targets technologically savvy and well-traveled consumers, the logistically complex and paperwork intensive certification process suffers in a small business environment where many dive store owners fail to leverage the powerful body of data lying dormant at at their fingertips. What should be a fun and encouraging process often becomes an unnecessary hassle for people looking to escape the ordinary demands of daily life. Submersimobile offers a radically alternative experience: A cloud based platform accessible on mobile and tablet devices that gives student divers the power to customize their class schedule and streamlines the logistical process that prevents many dive stores from delivering the type of outstanding customer service and transformative moments that produce lifelong divers.</p>

Their technology is the best of the best, but they have forgotten the most important thing; Locating charging locations from a mobile device. I have created Supercharged, which pulls data directly from Tesla to provide a worldwide map filled with Tesla certified charging locations. You can get directions to, favorite and find all locations with a few taps. It's available on Apple's App Store!</p>

                <i>Rails Instructor</i>
            </p>

            <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan _ all before he was 6 _ and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS & Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

                <br>
                <i>Front End Instructor</i>
            </p>

            <p>Justin spent the first 29 years of his life living in Massachusetts, Florida and New York. His move to Texas to teach for The Iron Yard was like a journey into the past. Exactly one hour into the past. Things just move a little more slowly here in the Central Time Zone, and we like it that way. Back in the future, Justin started out as a journalist. After spending a few years indulging his muse as a writer he moved on to study Natural Language Processing, the branch of computer science that deals with understanding and using human language. Essentially he's Joaquim Phoenix from the movie Her. He brings his love for language and his curiosity about AI (or the semblance thereof) to his Iron Yard curriculum on Front End Engineering and Python/Data Science.</p>

                <i>Campus Operations Manager</i>
            </p>

            <p>Christie was born in Houston, TX and was lucky enough to move to Nigeria when she was two weeks old.  She spent the first few years of her life in Nigeria and Angola before moving to Boston, Tulsa and then back to Houston.  Those early adventures sparked a lifelong love of travel and she has been all over the world and still has many places on her “list” to see one day.  She graduated from The Art Institute of Houston with an AAS degree in Film Production and earned her BA in Communications/PR/Advertising with a minor in English from The University of Houston. Christie spent many years in sales before becoming an Assistant Director of Admissions at her alma matter, The Art Institute of Houston. This was where she discovered her passion for helping others achieve their dreams through education. She is involved with a number of charities that help children, animals, veterans and others.  In her spare time, she loves to travel the world, write films, spend time with friends and family and hanging out with her two dachshunds Ben and Betty Lou.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from the man. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably Future of Web Apps Boston, JSFest, and JS.Everywhere(2013). He also is organizing a JavaScript conference right here in Houston: Space City JS.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>
