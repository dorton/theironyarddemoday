            <p>The Iron Yard Academy teaches intensive, three-month courses that mentor students into professional junior-level
              programmers. Our program goes far beyond tactical skills and teaches students to think like a software engineer.
              Students have spent the past twelve weeks studying Front End Engineering and Rails Engineering and
              today they will present their final projects, which showcase the skills they have learned.</p>

This program definitely was one of those - it has given me skills to develop my ideas and has introduced me to a great community.  I enjoy a good round of golf.</p>

                <i>Campus Director</i>
            </p>

            <p>Brian Dorton is the Campus Director in Houston. He was born in Victoria, TX and moved to Houston soon after graduating from Texas A&M with a BS in Biomedical Science. He worked in education for 10 years with experience ranging from classroom teacher to campus administrator and everything in between. He received his Masters in Educational Management in 2010 from the University of Houston Clear Lake. He has had the unique opportunity to see learning take place in students as young as 5 all the way through retiring professionals. Being able to facilitate that learning, and seeing the same ah ha moments on the faces of students, regardless of age, is what ignites the fire in him to continue this endeavor. He is a father of two beautiful girls who take up all of his free time and he also firmly believes that brisket is the only BBQ that should be considered BBQ.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Travis wrote his first line of Javascript on his birthday in 2014 and has been obsessed with coding ever since. He went through the Iron Yard program in the winter of 2014 and has worked as a teacher assistant during the last two cohorts helping students with everything from page layouts, Javascript syntax basics, advanced frameworks, user interface development, and programmatic problem solving. Recently, he has fallen in love with React.js and will talk to all interested and uninterested parties about the merits of the framework. When not in front of a computer, Travis enjoys miscellaneous events around the city, salsa dancing, two steppin, cooking, reading, and spending time with family.</p>

            </p>

            <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security - settling with two security certifications from the man. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; and several speaking arrangements at large conferences - notably Future of Web Apps Boston, JSFest, and JS.Everywhere(2013). He also is organizing a JavaScript conference right here in Houston: Space City JS.</p>

                <i>Front End Instructor</i>
            </p>

            <p>Justin spent the first 29 years of his life living in Massachusetts, Florida and New York. His move to Texas to teach for The Iron Yard was like a journey into the past. Exactly one hour into the past. Things just move a little more slowly here in the Central Time Zone, and we like it that way. Back in the future, Justin started out as a journalist. After spending a few years indulging his muse as a writer he moved on to study Natural Language Processing, the branch of computer science that deals with understanding and using human language. Essentially he's Joaquim Phoenix from the movie Her. He brings his love for language and his curiosity about AI (or the semblance thereof) to his Iron Yard curriculum on Front End Engineering and Python/Data Science.</p>

            </p>

            <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y'all. He was born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan _ all before he was 6 _ and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and JavaScripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS & Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>
